# Additional Information

## Transfer → Retries

Reading a file from Spectra S3 might trigger a Retry wait for up to 300 seconds when the file is not yet in the cache.

## Transfer → Multiple Connections

Use the lower right toggle to set the number of concurrent connections for file transfers. Refer to [Multiple Connections](../../Cyberduck/Transfer#MultipleConnections). This allows saturating the bandwidth when running in a fast local network.
