# Connection Profiles

[Connection profiles](../Cyberduck/Profiles) (`.cyberduckprofile`) are plugins describing specific connection settings for a hosting provider to make it easier to setup a connection to your provider. A connection profile is installed and adds a provider option in the protocol selection drop down menu in the *Connection* and *Bookmark* panels. No need to enter the connection details manually other than credentials.

## Preferences → Profiles

```{note}

```

Select connection protocols to be installed in addition to the default protocols listed above. The connection profile will be installed after enabling the corresponding checkbox. To disable a connection profile simply uncheck the checkbox. The profile will be disabled after closing the application.

```{note}
You can't disable the default protocols. If you disable the connection profile used in a bookmark the bookmark won't work after restarting the application.
