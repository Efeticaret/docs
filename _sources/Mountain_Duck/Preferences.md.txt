# Updates

An auto-update feature will alert you when a new version is available and self updates the application. Choose *Preferences → Automatically check for updates*. You can also choose to update to snapshot or beta builds.

- **Snapshot builds:** Include the latest changes and are published continuously. These builds are not manually tested.
- **Beta builds:** Published before a release and include the latest features and have been tested but might not have release quality yet.
